If you create an account, you agree to provide accurate and complete information. You also agree to update your account information in the event any of your information has changed.  You may not enter or use an email address owned or controlled by another person with the intent to impersonate that person, or that is offensive, or that violates the intellectual property or other rights of any person.  Failure to comply with the terms of this paragraph shall constitute a material breach of these Terms, which may result in a rejection or immediate termination of your account. We further reserve the right to cancel, in our sole discretion, your account at any time.</p>
